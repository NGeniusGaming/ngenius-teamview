## Configuring
> This project is driven off of the json configuration file located in `src/assets/configuration/config.json`.

The configuration is strongly typed based off the interface in `src/app/config/configuration.model.ts#Configuration`, doing this ensures that
we can accurately represent configuration and trust its consumption within the application.

### Twitch
> All Twitch configuration is kept within the top-level `twitch` property.
